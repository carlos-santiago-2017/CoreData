# CORE DATA

## Object Graph

Core Data is a Database system that uses and Object Graph to store objects instead of single values. This is a structure that comprises objects and their relationship.

We can store as many objects as we want, an also stablish their composition and how they are related with each other.

The system takes care of enconding and decoding the objects, preserving consistency, and storing the Object Graph on file in a efficient way.

# DATA MODEL

The structure of the Core Data's Object Graph is defined with a data model. This has nothing to do with the data model of the MVC pattern. it is a definition of the type of objects the graph is going to contain (called Entities) and ther connections (called RelationShips)
